### Project Description: Data Analysis and Visualization with Streamlit.

**Objective:**

In this project, you will perform an in-depth analysis of a provided dataset, create insightful visualizations, and develop an interactive dashboard using Streamlit. You will also deploy your Streamlit application on Streamlit Cloud and create a GitHub repository to showcase your project.

**Project Overview:**

1. **Dataset Analysis:**
    - **Task:** Analyze the provided dataset to extract meaningful insights.
    - **Requirements:**
        - Clean the dataset and handle any missing or inconsistent data.
        - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the key features and patterns.
        - Use descriptive statistics and visualizations to summarize the data.
        - Identify at least 8-10 key insights or key performance indicators (KPIs) that provide value to the dataset.
2. **Streamlit Application Development:**
    - **Task:** Build an interactive Streamlit application to display your findings.
    - **Requirements:**
        - Create a Streamlit application that allows users to interact with the dataset.
        - Implement visualizations for the 8-10 insights or KPIs using appropriate charts (e.g., bar charts, line charts, pie charts, histograms, scatter plots).
        - Add interactive elements such as sliders, dropdowns, and filters to allow users to explore the data dynamically.
        - Design a comprehensive dashboard that presents the insights in a user-friendly manner.
        - Ensure that the application is well-organized and easy to navigate.
3. **Deployment:**
    - **Task:** Deploy your Streamlit application to Streamlit Cloud.
    - **Requirements:**
        - Follow the deployment process to host your Streamlit application on Streamlit Cloud.
        - Ensure that the application is accessible and fully functional online.
        - Verify that all interactive elements and visualizations work as expected after deployment.
4. **GitHub Repository:**
    - **Task:** Create a GitHub repository to document and share your project.
    - **Requirements:**
        - Initialize a GitHub repository for your project.
        - Include the following in your repository:
            - **Code:** Upload all relevant Python scripts, including the Streamlit app code.
            - **Documentation:** Provide a detailed README file that includes:
                - An overview of the project and its objectives.
                - Instructions for running the Streamlit application locally.
                - Screenshots or descriptions of the dashboard and key insights.
                - Any additional notes or explanations relevant to the project.
            - **Deployment Information:** Include a link to the deployed Streamlit application on Streamlit Cloud.
